# LeveretTS

Leveret is a private util bot primarily used for its tag feature, that allows users to create and retrieve tags by their name.

Tags can contain executable "sandboxed" JavaScript code. This repository contains type definitions to write tags in TypeScript, debug them, build them, and deploy to Leveret.
