# LeveretTS

Leveret is a private util bot primarily used for its tag feature, that allows users to create and retrieve tags by their name.

Tags can contain executable "sandboxed" JavaScript code.

## Contents

This repository contains:

- type definitions to write tags in TypeScript, debug them, build them, and deploy to Leveret;
- a reverse-engineered Leveret version at `runner/bot`.
